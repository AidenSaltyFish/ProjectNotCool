# ReadMe
This is a course project in fulfillment of requirement of [course 02806, Social data analysis and visualization of Semester Spring 2022, in Technical University of Denmark](https://github.com/suneman/socialdata2022/wiki).

This website is developed via Hugo, with [template from Robert Austin](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme) and edited a little with love by Kewei Du.

ProjectNotCool is fully open-source. Please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/AidenSaltyFish/ProjectNotCool) for more information.

# Structure
Project NotCool contains three main parts. Each part holds a topic based on different perspective.

## [Part I : ]({{< ref "../posts/part_1.md" >}})

## [Part II : ]({{< ref "../posts/part_2.md" >}})
Geographically based, part II targets to find out the relation between the spatial distribution of high schools and that of registered tobacco retailers. Overviews of high schools and tobacco retailers in NYC with respect to each borough will be presented in an interactive way. We will discuss the relation at the end of this part via geographical data analysis.

## [Part III : ]({{< ref "../posts/part_3.md" >}})


# DataSets



# Main Libraries
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, Bokeh

# Some Tricks
#### Most of Geo maps are interactive -- you can click the button on the top-right to change the tiles and the layers
#### If you feel like a tooltip and there isn't -- dont't worry, give a shot by clicking the button on the top-right to reload the layer

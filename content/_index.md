title: You Never Know How Not Cool You Are

Smoking is NOT cool at all: it remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. Youth e-cigarette use arises new public health issues in recent years, which is report that [almost 85 percent of the more than 2 million middle and high school students have used e-cigarettes in USA in 2021](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/youth-e-cigarette-use-remains-serious-public-health-concern-amid-covid-19-pandemic). This topic soon rewind our memories back to high school time, when we had a friend with his cigarette all the time since then. He carried a four-inch long air-polluter and thinking themselves as the coolest people all over the world in the chocking smoke. For times we were trying to talk him into quitting, but he would always come back to enjoy his little e-cigarette in cola flavor again and again (Check the video below! He's there!). 

**Good health and well-being** is one of the primary topics in [sustainable development](https://sdg-tracker.org/). Encouraging smoking would be an enormous impedance in terms of achieving the sustainable goals, due to tobacco's science-proved damage to human health. Inspired by our friend, we are wondering how many high schoolers out there are just like him. We would aldo like to dig further on studying the factors contributing to their addiction to cigarette via data-driven methods.

In this project we are going to analyze NYC high school students' smoking behaviors, and to be more specific, how old are they do they start smoking. To dive deep on this issue, we combined three open dataset: the USA Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey results, the NYC School Survey results, the 2019 NYC high school directory, and 2019 NYC licensed tobacco retailers.

We picked *interactive magazine* as our presentation genre and divided our work into three parts, where you can read each of them as a blog. Through the journey exploring the insight of data with us, you would encounter many interesting plots: some of them are very scientific and some are fairly plain to understand, some are interactive to click and some are static to enjoy. Try to play with each of them to see you can find something!

We sincerely hope that you would grasp some current situation of youth tobacco use in the Usnited States. It is highly recommended to quickly scanning the manual in [Outline page]({{< ref "/outline/_index.md" >}}), which states the structure of the whole project, as well as some tricks in playing with the data and their visualizations. If you are fully prepared, please refer to [Content page]({{< ref "/posts/_index.md" >}}) for everything we have done for the project.

Have fun and hope you enjoy our stop-motion!

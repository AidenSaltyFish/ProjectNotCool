    "# Motivation of the project\n",
    "Smoking is NOT cool at all: it remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. Youth e-cigarette use arises new public health issues in recent years, which is report that almost 85 percent of the more than 2 million middle and high school students have used e-cigarettes in USA in 2021. This topic soon rewind our memories back to high school time, when we had a friend with his cigarette all the time since then. He carried a four-inch long air-polluter and thinking themselves as the coolest people all over the world in the chocking smoke. For times we were trying to talk him into quitting, but he would always come back to enjoy his little e-cigarette in cola flavor again and again (Check the video below! He’s there!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Good health and well-being is one of the primary topics in sustainable development. Encouraging smoking would be an enormous impedance in terms of achieving the sustainable goals, due to tobacco’s science-proved damage to human health. Inspired by our friend, we are wondering how many high schoolers out there are just like him. We would aldo like to dig further on studying the factors contributing to their addiction to cigarette via data-driven methods."

    "Tobacco control is always a heated topic within sustainability, especially the smoking behaviors among teeangers. It is part of the UN's sustainable goal to regulate the average age of tobacco users, and to avoid teenagers to smoke with full care and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to analyze NYC high school students' smoking behaviors, and to be more specific, how old are they do they start smoking. To dive deep on this issue, we combined three open dataset: the USA Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey results, the NYC School Survey results, the 2019 NYC high school directory, and 2019 NYC licensed tobacco retailers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first two are survey results gathered from students, where YRBSS dataset contains in total 500,000 high school students' individual responses every other year from 1991 to 2019 all across USA, and NYC School Survey gives statistics of over 1000 schools of 5 boroughs in NYC every year aiming to evaluate the school's quality. With NYC high school directory we can focus on the high schools students only, and tobbaco retailers help to further expand our vision to see how commercialization of tobacco relates to exact smoking behaviors of teenagers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To operate on a sufficient dataset, we extracted YRBSS results from 2007, because NYC School Survey started from 2007, and the NYC school survey in 2017 to 2019 because questions and answers have been consistent within these three years.\n",

    "### Comments of demographic overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gender\n",
    "The dataset contains fairly unbiased distribution on genders, with gender ratio approximate to 1:1 for each borough, except that Manhattan shows a slightly higher proportion of female respondants with about 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Race\n",
    "- Respondants of the 5 boroughs don't share the same race distribution. Bronx, Manhatten and Queens are dominated by Hispanic/Latino students, while Brooklyn reports more Black/African American participants. To our surprise, Staten Island seems to be the only borough that are mostly comprised of White students.\n",
    "- Seeing from the line chart of the four ethnic groups in each borough, the race distribution of each borough remains rather steady through the years. Only few intersections, such as Black/African American with Hispanic/Latino in Brooklyn and White with Hispanic/Latino in Staten Island are shown, implying small fluctuations of the racial diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age/Grade\n",
    "- The dataset is sampled in a similar distribution of age groups across boroughs, where 14-17 year-old participants takes part in the majority. Age 14, 15, 16 and 17 each contributes roughly 20%-25% of the total samples in each borough.\n",
    "- Similarly, the grade distribution is also the same across boroughs. The dataset is of high school students, so grade 9-12 are evenly sampled in all 5 boroughs.\n",
    "- Further check on the age distribution by grade across all boroughs, it can be seen that grade 9 students are centered around 14 years old, grade 10 around 15 years old, and so on and so forth. There are no signs of early or late schooling in any borough, because their pattern of grade-age distribution is almost the same."

In particular, Staten Island seems to be the hot zone of heavy smokers, with smallest percentage of those who only smoke 1 or 2 days and largest percentage of those who smoke on all 30 days. In fact the percentage (and absolute number, too) of day-to-day smokers in Staten Island is so large that it doubles that of Manhatten.\n",

    "- The patterns of days of smoking e-vapor and cigars per month don't differ much between boroughs.\n",
    "- Smoking regular cigarettes, e-vapor products and cigars and alike are not strongly correlated, which means that smoking one type of product doesn't imply smoking other two products, and smoking one product very often in the last month doesn't necessarily imply smoking other two also that often.\n",
    "- The frequency of smoking different products among smokers are  higher correlated than that of among the whole population, indicating the possible predictability whithin smokers."

    "#### Comment\n",
    "- The model on all students doesn't work well enough as expected. It shows an extreme bias on \"no smoking\", skewing the prediction very much. More than 60% of smokers who started smoking before 13 and about 75% of smokers who started after 13 were classified as non-smoking. Possible reasons of this lie in the sizes of these two groups. Compared to over 7000 records of non-smokers, the latter two only constitute about 1000 records. This lead to the model to be underfitting, and unable to learn the smokers' characteristics, compared to the non-smokers. The issue would be relieved if given a larger dataset.\n",
    "- The model trained on only smokers are much less biased compared to the previous model. Both class reaches an accuracy of 70%. Considering the limited size, we can only claim the model is performing well within the existed dataset. The generalization performance is still in doubt.\n",
    "- Some conclusions, or perhaps assumptions can still be drawn from the comparisons, regardless of the unsatisfying results. Non-smoking high school students would always be the majority, whether they would start smoking is not always predictable, but once they pick up smoking, there might be some pattern in all kinds of behaviors, where adults and administrations can get in the way, and imporse some positive effects.\n"

    "- Seeing from the top 20 most important features of the smoker model, `q40`, when started drinking alcohol, tops at first. This suggests that starting to smoke and starting to drink are not seperate events -- once the guard to one is down, the other might soon collapse. Similarly, `q46`, also in the top 5, describes the initiation age of marijuana usage. These three features combined informed us that regulations should not be isolated, and a sustainable city shall maintain a good balance in all. \n",
    "- `q59` describes the age of first sexual intercourse, which in combination with the tobacco, drug and alcohol complete a teenage group profile who are highly curious, impulsive and reckless, and eager to feel like adults by making not cool decisions. \n",
    "- `distance` and `score` are listed the 2nd and the 3rd, meaning that our assumption that the social environments influence smoking initiation is also proved to some extent. How this two feature differ the smoking initiation age is demonstrated in the following chart.\n",
    "- `density`, on the other hand, is not as influential as the other two envrionmental factors. The impurity lessened by it alone is only half that of the other two. It seems it does not matter that much the average number of retailers against schools, but the specific neighborhood condition of each individual school contained in `distance`.\n",
    "- Demographic features, such as `race` and `sitecode` are not very important in this model, even though we found different distributions of all years of 5 boroughs in YRBSS's analysis.\n"

    "- The difference within smokers who start smoking at different ages show different patterns in all the features we explored. The age of smoking initiation seems to positively related with all these 5 factors: age of starting drinking alcohol, distance to retailers, school's supportive score, age of starting using marijuana, age of first sextual intercourse. Younger age of catching up alcohol, drug and sex often predicts younger age of smoking, too. Same with the school factors, if a school is located further from tobacco retailers, and receives a higher supportive score, the students attending this school are likely to start smoking later in life. \n",
    "- The lesson we can learn from this result complies with our common sense, but powerful: Keep your kid away from any of this: alcohol and drug, will help them stay away from tobacco, too. Sexual education, school's societal environmental building-up and a clean, peaceful neighborhood would support their healthy behaviors, and any administrator and stakeholder in the related departments should bare this in mind, to make their city more upright and sustainable for the younger people."

    "# Visualization\n",
    "visualization in the project varies from static plots to interactive plots, from statistical plots to plain figures. We will discuss the choice of visualization in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geo-plots\n",
    "All geo-plots in the project in implemented with *folium* library. A typical geo-plot in the project should have layers whose visibility is customizable to readers by clicking the embedded layer button on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choropleth plot appears most frequent in the layers, as one of the most common geo-data structure we were facing is the value distribution with respect to the five boroughs in NYC. Choropleth plot can precisely describe the geographical distribution using distinguishable colors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Markers are used only once for marking high school locations on the map. They are effective when comes to demonstrating exact locations of a dataset in a small scale on the map. However, things become messy when you try to mark too many locations on the map due to their memory consuming nature. Our machine died once for running more than 4,000 retailers markers on the map. That is also the reason we limit its usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heatmap provides readers with straight and decent experience, which is the perfect choice for identifying where something occurs, and demonstrate areas of high and low density. We used heatmap for describing the retailer distribution and density. We found that heatmap shows its excellence also at the time when plotting the exact location is not important, or not possible: it does a good job leaving readers with quick impressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined with a time slider bar, choropleth in time series offers a power tool for visualization over time. Dataset with data from multiple years are shown with this type of visualization mostly. Through dragging the top bar, readers can check the differences across the timescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Plots\n",
    "Statistical plots are implemented in various ways. *Bokeh* library is applied for making interactive plots in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stacked bar plot, with fixed vertical length and flexible partial length for each element representing the accounted portion, makes itself much repetitive appearance in Part I. This type of plot offers an easy way for readers to compare among data from different items, say boroughs, while sometimes people may think pie chart is a little clumsy when comes to compare across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic bar plot and line chart are always solid. Box plot gives a visual summary of the data , through which readers can quickly identify mean values, the dispersion of the data set, and signs of skewness. It is useful when we are talking about data distributions."

    "# Genre to choose\n",
    "Built on the *Magazine* and *Annotated Graph* genres introduced in Segal and Heer paper, we applied several methods on visual presentation and narrative presentation to better help us tell an attractive and logical story.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Presentation\n",
    "We believe that good visual presentation could facilitate readers understanding our intention hiding in the context. For instance, heavily relying on geo-plot to demonstrate information with respect to boroughs, the project introduces many interactive geo-plots plotted via *folium* library. In these plots, readers are able to interact by changing map tiles and data layers to combine the information they prefer. Other examples can also be found in plots from *Bokeh* library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also value the power of design. we would like to present our project on a simple, bold, powerful or even little aggressive website. Starting from an open-source template, we made decent modifications to achieve the desired visual effect as presented. With a you-can-not-miss-it title, readers could be attracted by the article even at a quick glance.\n",

    "Franking speaking, we are satisfied with the topic of the project. Having had a friend who addicted himself to cigarette, we are happy to have the chance to dig into a problem that we actually care about. \n",
    "\n",
    "About the project contents, we do believe that it contains a large volume of work with decent analysis on three individual topics related to the project. In total we presented more than 30 plots in our project, as well as large amount of explanations. We do appreciate our time spent on the project by generating better analysis and reading experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving into the data is always the toughest part, and we have successfully cracked the mystery inside with plenty of labor understanding them. Some data came in the form of questionnaire, where we had to pay extra work finding the explanation to each answer. To make things worse, data from different years came with different sets of answer, for which we had to do a large amount of data cleaning and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given large amount of visualization, we did a nice job delivering them in a various and interactive way. Tools such as *folium* and *Bokeh* libraries for interactive plots are applied for better visual effect. We made a great effort on creating interactive plots, especially for the geo-plots. We believe that we have achieved\n",
    "our goal on visualizations at present.\n",

    "### What Is To Improve\n",
    "- When working with data one should always be skeptical how real one dataset is representative of the whole population, and our dataset would not totally avoid bias, either. The dataset could be worked with more advanced statistical techniques to mitigate the bias and reach a more true reflection of everyone.\n",
    "- To combine multiple datasets we did not use genuine data but simulated with possible values, this could possibly influence the machine learning model, and indicate false interrelationships within features.\n",
